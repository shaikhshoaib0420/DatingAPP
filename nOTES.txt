promise                           observable   
Provides a single future value    Emits multiple values over time
Not lazy                          Lazy
Can not cancel                    Able to cancel
                                  Can use with map, filter, reduce 
                                  and other operators

Observable:

	ReplaySubject : Special type of observable which provide last value of buffer.

obaservable should have suffix "$".

video no 55 recap:
for storage purpose: (In localStorage and observable(replaySubject)) 
	first of all we take the response from login function of AccountSercice.ts file 
	as username and tokken, the assigning it to user variable of User Interface of type(username, token),
	setting up user variable in localstorage after stringifying it, and then storing it in observable
	currentUserSource. 
for display purpose:(taking from localStorage parse it and store in observable(replaysubject))
	1)Then in app.component.ts file we initialized setCurrentUser which take the user item from localstorage
	parse it(opposite of stringifying it) and the store and again setting it in observable(replaysubject).
	2) After logging in In nav.component.ts file initializing function getCurrentUser which see the observable(currentUser$),
	is empty or filled with user. if filled the making loggedIn variable as ture else false. and will persist the 
	username and token on console as it stored in localStorage and then observable, if not logged out. Because logout 
	function in accountService.ts file remove item from localStorage and nullify the observable.



video no 56 recape:
	Directly using observable(replaySubject) i.e. currentUser$ in nav.component.html and
	nav.component.ts file instead of boolean variable loggedIn.

 Doubts : 1) using currentUser$ instead of loggedIn makes navigation baar invisible.
	  2) this.currentSource.next(null) doesn't work.
	  3) bullet execution of getUser() doesn't work, lengthy method does. 
	  4) emit function doesn't taking boolean var as parameter.
	  5) source control pushing.

Video no. 61 to be implemented.
